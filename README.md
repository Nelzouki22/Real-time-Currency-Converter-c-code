# Real-time Currency Converter c++code
To create a real-time currency converter in C++, you can use an API to get the latest exchange rates. One such API is the ExchangeRate-API, which provides free and paid plans for accessing real-time exchange rates.

Here's how you can build a simple currency converter in C++ using this API:

Sign Up for an API Key:
Go to the ExchangeRate-API website and sign up for a free API key.

Install Dependencies:
You will need a library to make HTTP requests in C++. One popular choice is cURL. If you don't have cURL installed, you can install it using your package manager.

Write the C++ Code:
